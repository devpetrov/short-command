All docker aliases start with 'd' followed by a letter for subcommand:

	(l) - docker logs

In this sequence 'c' is reserved for docker compose aliases (dc)

Under windows bash emulators winpty may be required in some cases.
For this purpose if winpty is available on the system docker compose aliases
will have winpty included in them.

For information about aliases for docker-compose try
$ cahelp docker-compose
